## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the Freight Frenzy (2021-2022) competition season.

## Welcome To Legacy Code!
# Hello CHC Students, CHC Alum, Current GATech students, and others!
This repository is the result of hours of work from the Cape Henry Collegiate FTC Challenge 2022 team.
The main purpose of this code is for new generations of club members to view what past teams have done
and hopefully learn from their mistakes and successes.

## Notes from this year
# Mostly Mechanical...
For whoever is working on this, a lot of what happened in 2022's challenge revolved a lot around
the mechanics of the worm gear and the net force of the friction force and gravity

# Software Stuff!
This is my bread and butter here so lets just jump into it! First of all, to properly have this system work,
we need to train our own AI model. I was going to do this, but ran out of time and other pressing matters were
against me (teaching people to program). Next time, take a look at training your own model instead of using the pregen
as it can lead to more accuracy. For details on this, go check out a few tutorials on YT (or even better) an FTC team uploaded a
wonderful video on how to do this on their YT using just applications (no coding experience neccesary, although I do recommend knowledge on
how images are stored).
